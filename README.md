# Generative Art Script (Python)

A simple generative 2D art script which uses Pillow. Creates a black square image, draws two gradients on top of it, then draws a number of connected lines randomly positioned within constraints. Line color interpolates between two random colors. Each line has a chance to get thicker than the previous one. The resulting image goes through a filter, then gets downsized 2x. A batch of 10 images is produced when you run the program.

I'm learning the basics of generative 2D art and got the general line drawing idea from an online tutorial. The gradient & probability parts are my own addition.
